# AddPopInfoToODBPP
Adds the populated/not populated info to Altium Designer ODB++ Output

- ODB++ Data is generated by standard Altium Designer Outjob
- A reduced Bom with only the used component designators is created
- The Bom is read by the script and the populated/not populated information from the bom is written to the component files in the ODB++ Data. After that the ODB++ folder structure is stored in the original .tgz-file.
